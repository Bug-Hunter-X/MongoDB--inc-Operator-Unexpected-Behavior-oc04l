# MongoDB $inc Operator Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The `$inc` operator is intended to increment a numeric field by a specified value. However, if the field does not exist or is not a number, it can lead to unexpected results.

## Bug Description
The provided code attempts to increment a field using `$inc`, but does not properly handle cases where the field does not exist or is not a numeric type.  This results in the field not being updated correctly or throwing errors depending on the MongoDB version and settings.

## Bug Solution
The solution involves using the $inc operator correctly and checking if the field exists and is of the correct data type before attempting to increment it. The solution below uses a combination of a conditional check and the $inc operator to ensure proper handling of various scenarios.

## How to Reproduce
1. Create a MongoDB collection.
2. Insert a document without the target field.
3. Attempt to run the buggy `$inc` operation in bug.js.
4. Verify that the field is not updated as expected.

## How to Run the Solution
1. Create a MongoDB collection.
2. Run the code in bugSolution.js.
3. Verify that the field is correctly updated.
